    In Spring 2021, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen levy</a> and I taught a new course, <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs1340/2021sp/">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).</a>The course is
    designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a range of ethical, societal, and
    policy implications of computing and information.

          This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2017fa/">Networks</a>.The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no
          formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the
          chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.
